/**
 * Trait BelongsToAuthor
 *
 * Provides a standardized way for Eloquent models to establish a "belongs to" relationship with a User model, representing the author or creator of the model instance.
 * This trait encapsulates common author-related logic, promoting code reusability and consistency across different models within the application.
 *
 * This trait is particularly useful for models that require tracking ownership or authorship, such as articles, comments, or any content created by users.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Simplifies the definition of the `author()` relationship.
 * - Offers a convenient method to assign the currently authenticated user as the author.
 * - Provides a method to explicitly set any User instance as the author.
 * - Ensures the author relationship is persisted immediately upon assignment.
 *
 * Integration:
 * To utilize this trait, simply include it in your Eloquent model: `use BelongsToAuthor;`
 *
 * @package App\Models\Relations
