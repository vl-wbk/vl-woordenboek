/**
 * DraftState handles the state transitions for articles in the Draft state.
 *
 * When an article is in the Draft state, it can be transitioned to an Approval state for further review, or reverted to a New (suggestion) state if changes are needed.
 * This class implements those transitions by overriding the methods inherited from the ArticleState base class.
 *
 * Key behaviors implemented in this class:
 * - transitionToApproved(): Changes the article from Draft to Approval state.
 * - transitionToSuggestion(): Reverts the article to a New state and clears the assigned editor, all within a database transaction to ensure data consistency.
 *
 * This design allows for clear separation of behaviors based on the article's current state, making it easier for developers to understand and extend state-specific logic.
