/**
 * The NewState class represents the initial state of an article when it is first created.
 * It encapsulates the behavior specific to a freshly created article, particularly how it can transition to a state where editing is permitted.
 * This state class builds on the common functionality provided by its parent, ArticleState, to ensure that the article's state is managed consistently.
 *
 * The transitionToEditing method defined here allows an article in the New state to move into an editable state by performing a database transaction.
 * Within this transaction, the current user becomes associated as the article's editor, and the article's state is updated to indicate that work on it has started.
 * This approach of bundling related state changes within a transaction helps maintain data integrity by ensuring that all required changes occur together.
