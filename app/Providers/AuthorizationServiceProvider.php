 * Class AuhtorizationServiceProvider
 *
 * TThe service provider is primarily rersponsible for registering authorization policies with the Gate facade?
 * It's particularly useful for associating policies with Eloquent models that reside outside of the application's core 'app' directory; such as models provided by Composer packages.
 * In this specific case, it registers the 'BanPolicy' with the 'Ban' model from the 'cog/laravel-ban' package.
 * This ensuire that when authorization checks are performed against the 'ban' model instances, the 'BanPolicy' will be used to determine whether the action is allowed.
 * By explicitly registering for external models, we ensure that Laravels authorization system correctly recognizes and applies the appropriate access control rules.µ
