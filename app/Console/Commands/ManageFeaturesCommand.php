 * ManageFeaturesCommand is a console command for managing feature flags in the application.
 *
 * This command provides administrators and developers with the ability to enable, disable,
 * or check the status of feature flags. It integrates with Laravel Pennant to manage
 * feature toggles globally and ensures that feature states are consistently applied
 * across the application.
 *
 * The command accepts two arguments:
 * - `action`: Specifies the operation to perform (enable, disable, or status).
 * - `feature`: The name of the feature flag to manage.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Enables feature flags globally for all users.
 * - Disables feature flags globally for all users.
 * - Checks the current status of a feature flag.
 * - Resolves feature class names dynamically to ensure proper namespace handling.
