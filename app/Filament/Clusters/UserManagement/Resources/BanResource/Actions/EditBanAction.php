/**
 * Welcome to the Edit Ban Action - a key part of our moderation system.
 *
 * This action handles the editing of account deactivations through a modal interface.
 * We've designed it to be straightforward: moderators can update both the reason and duration of a deactivation in one place.
 * You'll notice we use Dutch throughout the interface since that's our community's language, and we prefer the term "deactivation" over "ban" to keep things professional.
 *
 * The interface includes confirmation steps to prevent accidental changes, and we make sure to show clear feedback messages in case something goes wrong.
 * The whole system integrates seamlessly with our permission system through the UserPolicy.
 *
 * Feel free to extend this action - common improvements might include adding new fields, customizing the update process, or enhancing the validation rules.
 *
 * @see \App\Policies\UserPolicy  For authorization rules regaring the action
