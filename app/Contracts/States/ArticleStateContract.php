 * The ArticleStateContract interface defines a set of methods for managing the state transitions of an article.

 * By implementing this contract, state management becomes predictable and consistent across the application.
 * Each method should contain the logic required to carry out the specific transition and any accompanying side effects (e.g., logging, notifications, or validations).
