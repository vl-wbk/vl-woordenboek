/**
 * ReportArticleModal is a Livewire component that displays a modal for reporting an article.
 *
 * This component takes in an Article model and makes it available to a corresponding view,
 * where users can submit a report regarding issues with the article.
 *
 * Key points for future developers:
 * - The component expects an Article instance to be passed during initialization (via route model binding or otherwise).
 * - The mount() method ensures that the provided article model is set up correctly for use within the component.
 * - The render() method returns a view ("livewire.report-article-modal") and passes the Article instance to it,
 *   so that the view can display details about the article and provide an interface for reporting.
 *
 * Developers can easily extend or customize this component to include extra validation, dynamic behavior, or additional data as required by the project's reporting workflow.
